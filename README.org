*** Overview
    F4 is Eclipse-based IDE for [[http://fantom.org][Fantom]] programming language, which is written mostly on Fantom using F4 itself.

*** Compiling 
    Currently we store compiled pods right in plug-ins, as F4 can be built only using F4. Therefore, to work on F4 sources use the following workflow:
    - Install latest development snapshot from [[http://download.xored.com/f4/nightly/][F4 Nightly Downloads]] into [[http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-372/indigosr2/][Eclipse Indigo Classic]].
    - Clone this repository and import all projects
    - Clone [[http://github.com/xored/fantom-runtime][Fantom Runtime]] and import all projects

    Now you can modify its sources and launch runtime version of F4 to check whether it works as expected.

*** Packaging
    - Run =mvn clean verify= in project root to build update site containing F4 features, F4 as standalone product and run [[http://rcptt.xored.com][RCPTT]] tests. Update site will be assembled into =repository/target/repository= folder, products—under =product/target/products/=.
